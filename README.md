# ecommerce-merng-platform

I am starting this project for my underwear business so I don't need to depend on other ecommerce platforms.

## What it is ?

ecommerce-merng-platform is part of sovrakofanela.gr a underwear company. As a developer I try to create an ecommerce CMS with modern technologies like Typescript, React etc.

## Why open source ?

I am a huge supporter of open source projects , because I want the user to know, what I am doing with his information. Also I want to help young developers with their projects.
Some advanced features of the project will not be open source, because I've spent a lot of time and money on them. Yet they will not be for sale, they are just for me and the company.

## Contributing

You can contribute to the project now if you want, yet when release 2.0 comes it will be ready for Contributing. Now the main idea is beeing developed and the platform lack of features.

## What features we have in mind.

1) Beeing able to create categories and add products and specific filters to each category.
2) Creating products, with attributes and variants of you choice.
3) Embeded marketing, so you can create facebook, instagram and google ads from the admin panel.
4) Analytics about sales, sessions and much more.
5) SEO friendly, you will be able to create custom seo titles and descriptions for products and categories.
6) Scanning and adding products will be available with the Scanning API
