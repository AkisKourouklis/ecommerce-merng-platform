# Ecommerce Merng Platform

> An ecommerce cms created with Typescript, Graphql, React & Mongodb


As a retail store owner I faced a lot of problems keeping my store up and running problems from stock keeping, checkout and a lot more.
With other up and ready platforms I could not add custom funcitonality, and if I wanted to I had to buy plugins that cost a lot more than
they worth. With this platform I wanted to created an easy to user interface that other developers could user to craete an ecommerce website.
Futhermore if you know nodejs and react you can easily fork and modify the code as you want it.
